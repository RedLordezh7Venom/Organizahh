I accidentally deleted the commit history , by forcing push to master

first deleted the .git when the push failed 
then force pushed


--lost 22 + commit history, 
well the entire project still remains,
the development process was lost 
this means earlier versions are unrecoverable
git push  -- force was a huge mistake , never do it again
