I accidentally deleted the commit history , by forcing push to master

first deleted the .git when the push failed 
then force pushed
didn't see the warning on chatgpt

--lost 22 + commit history, 
well the entire project still remains,
the development process was lost 
this means earlier versions are unrecoverable
there were important commits, including the first prototype, how it went from langchain script to UX and app
other commits like, 8 commits of fixing the app and implementing qt interface 
here are the commits from the powershell terminal history:
    "built newtkapp.exe, for build artifacts"
    "removed tests for newtkapp"
    "removed pytests for now"
    "added dockerfile, removed flint CI"
    "fixed python version for  CI/CD" 
    "Added CI/CD"    
    "need to add llamafile in python , implement first "
    "added tests"
    "added requirements.txt"
    "llamafile working"
    "simple llamafile addition, lamba.py"  
    "llamafile"    

    #Tried adding and removed andr.py, now lost, had kivy implementation for android app, the old failed UI are gone too
    "qtinterface built with drag drop, minimal hassle but UI too simple"
    "Working delete+rename"
    "Working rename"  
    git commit -"removed json git rm --cached '*.json'    : important :  deletes form staging area and NOT  the local repo
     "remove json"          
     "Rename and delete not working for sub"
     "Rename and delete not working for subcategories"
     "newtkapp added with functionality, need package use, clean code"
     "Initial commit"
git push  -- force was a huge mistake , never do it again
doesn't really matter now, there's no way going back, will develop the remaining part  : 4may2025

some ci commits are still visible, but that's upto 5 commits
since commits still exist on github (via hashed) , i got back the initial commit :n https://github.com/RedLordezh7Venom/Organizahh/commit/979d5b939e63272705ba5a9ceca0cbdb24f813ee

so , I'll just brute force all the old commits, the first 7 characters of the SHA hash that is used (insane) , by bruteforcing it 
it's just 7 characters
